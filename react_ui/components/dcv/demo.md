# AWS DCV Integration Demo

## Testing the Integration

To test the AWS DCV live view integration, you can simulate a `browser_init` tool response:

### Sample Browser Init Tool Response

```
Browser session initialized successfully.
Session ID: session-demo-12345
Region: us-east-1
<presigned_url>https://dcv-gateway.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/session-demo-12345?token=sample-token-abc123&expires=1704067200&auth-token=xyz789</presigned_url>
The browser is ready for automation. You can now view the live session.
```

### Expected Behavior

1. **Tool Detection**: The system should detect this as a `browser_init` tool
2. **Button Display**: A blue "Open Live View" button should appear in the tool result
3. **URL Validation**: The presigned URL should be validated successfully
4. **Session Info**: Session ID should be displayed
5. **Click Action**: Clicking the button should open `/dcv-viewer/[encodedUrl]` in a new tab

### Testing Steps

1. **Manual Test**: 
   - Copy the sample tool response above
   - Create a mock tool call with `name: "browser_init"` and `result: [sample response]`
   - Verify the DCVButton renders correctly

2. **URL Extraction Test**:
   ```typescript
   import { extractPresignedUrl, validatePresignedUrl } from '@/lib/dcv/dcv-utils';
   
   const sampleResult = `Browser session initialized successfully.
   <presigned_url>https://dcv-gateway.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/session-demo-12345?token=abc123</presigned_url>`;
   
   const url = extractPresignedUrl(sampleResult);
   console.log('Extracted URL:', url);
   console.log('Is valid:', validatePresignedUrl(url));
   ```

3. **Integration Test**:
   - Navigate to the chat interface
   - Look for any `browser_init` tool results
   - Verify the "Open Live View" button appears
   - Click the button to test the DCV viewer page

### Mock DCV Session

Since the demo URL is not a real DCV session, the viewer will show:
- ✅ DCV SDK loading successfully
- ✅ URL validation passing
- ❌ Authentication/connection failing (expected)
- ✅ Error handling displaying appropriate message
- ✅ Retry functionality available

### Production Usage

In production, when the assistant actually calls the `browser_init` tool:
1. A real AWS DCV session will be created
2. A valid presigned URL will be returned
3. The DCV viewer will successfully connect
4. Users can interact with the remote browser session

### Troubleshooting

If the button doesn't appear:
- Check that the tool name is exactly `browser_init`
- Verify the result contains `<presigned_url>...</presigned_url>` tags
- Check browser console for any errors

If the DCV viewer fails to load:
- Verify DCV files are in `/public/dcvjs/`
- Check network tab for 404 errors on DCV resources
- Ensure the presigned URL is valid and not expired
